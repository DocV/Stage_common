Stage engine common library
=======

Stage is an experiment in creating a small, proof-of-concept game engine using actor-based parallelization. Since the engine was created for a master's thesis written at a Finnish university, all of the code comments are currently in Finnish (sorry, non-Finns!).
This repository contains the files that are common to all three implementations of the Stage engine. Please refer to the actual implementations at:

https://github.com/DocV/Stage (actor-based implementation)  
https://github.com/DocV/Stage_control (single-threaded implementation)  
https://github.com/DocV/Stage_11 (implementation based on C++11 threads)
